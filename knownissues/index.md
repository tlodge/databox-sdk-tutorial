- **Chrome fullscreen**

When you view the uibuilder in chrome fullsreen, if you move an object it will be displaced by a random amount.  Seems that the mouse stops listening and so the offsets can't be adjusted


- **Low resolution screens**

SDK works on lower-resolution screens, but it's currently diffcult to use.
