title: function tutorials

This set of tutorials is aimed at getting you writing apps that make use of the **dbfunction** (databox functon) node.  The dbfunction node allows you to write javascript code to process data.  Unlike other nodes, it is relatively unconstrained. 

There are a few headline things that you need to know:

- values **returned** by functions are sent as messages. If you do not wish to send a message, simply return nothing.
- to send multiple outputs, you send an array (item at index 0 is sent on the first output, at index 1 on the second output and so on)
- you are able to import npm libraries.  When you subsequently test a function a new container is built with any imported libraries installed.
- functions can store and access data to use between invocations using a  **context** object:

```javascript
//store foo
context.set("foo", myvalue)

//retrieve foo
var myvalue = context.get("foo") || adefaultvalue
``` 

- Several nodes need to know the 'shape' of data that they are receiving as input.  If the function nodes is sending data to one of these nodes, then it has to specify its schema.   

The following tutorials make use of functions in some way
