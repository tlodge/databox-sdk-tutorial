There are a bunch of containers that the sdk uses, and this is a listing of what they are, what they do and where they can be found:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>container</th>
      <th>repo</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  	<tr>
      <td>tlodge/databox-sdk</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/me-box/platform-sdk">https://github.com/me-box/platform-sdk</a></td>
      <td>This is the sdk container, it serves up the dev environment and reads/wriets to github, appstore and registry as appropriate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>tlodge/databox-test-server</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/tlodge/databox-test-app">https://github.com/tlodge/databox-test-app</a></td>
      <td>This is the container that runs tests for the sdk. The base image is tlodge/databox-test-server-base.   Node-red instances connect to it to send data, which it then sends to a the client over websockets. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>This is the base images used to build TEST containers.  It is an instance of node-red alongside the nodes that are supported in the SDK.  The nodes can send messages to the databox-test-server over json-sockets which send messages to the client over websockets</td>
